# Document Structure

To ensure all informations are simple to understand for everyone, the structure of all documents should be formatted.

## Formattiing

There is the format the documents have to follow:

### Titles

- Main Title
</br>
There is only one main title, it should be wrote like this:
```
# Title
```

- Subtitle
</br>
The number of subtitles should be as low as possible, as it makes the document longer than it needs to be if there are to many subtitles.
A subtitle will be written this way:
```
## Subtitle
```

- Second subtitle
</br>
You can add as many second subtitles as you want.
A subtitle will be written this way:
```
## Second subtitle
```

### Lists

Prefer using unordered lists if it is possible, like this
```
- Line1
- Line2
- Line3
```

---

### New lines

Always use the HTML tag, alone on the line, as it makes it very clear. Here is an example:
```
Line 1
</br>
Line 2
```

---

### Paragraph formatting

All kind of titles should be followed by an empty line.
</br>
All the other elements should have no empty lines inside the block, but the block should be followed by a new line.
</br>
Inside a block, one line have to be one sentence, one item of a list or anything.
A line have to be one element and only one as it makes it easier to read and underdtand if it has to be changed.
Example:
```
# Title

Block of 6 lines
</br>
- list
- list
- list
</br>
Last line of the block

*** new block ***
```
