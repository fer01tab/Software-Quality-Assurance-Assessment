# Task estimation

## Why estimate in Scrum?

In Scrum, estimation is not about pinpoint accuracy, but rather about creating a shared understanding among the development team about the relative effort required for each user story. This shared understanding helps with:

- Sprint planning: The team can choose a set of user stories that they believe can be realistically completed within a sprint timeframe.
- Forecasting: The product owner can get a sense of how long it will take to complete the product backlog.
- Transparency: Stakeholders can see how much work is in progress and how quickly the team is delivering value.


## Estimation techniques in Scrum:

- Planning Poker: In Planning Poker, each team member estimates a user story relative to a predefined scale (e.g., Fibonacci sequence). Team members discuss their estimates and then vote again until they reach a consensus.
- T-Shirt Sizing: In T-Shirt Sizing, team members estimate a user story by assigning it a T-shirt size (e.g., XS, S, M, L, XL). This is a quick and easy technique that can be helpful for early-stage estimation.

- Ideal Days: In Ideal Days, team members estimate a user story by considering how many ideal days (i.e., days without interruptions) it would take to complete the story.

## What to estimate in Scrum?

In Scrum, the focus is on estimating user stories, not individual tasks. This is because user stories represent a unit of work that can be delivered to the product owner. However, teams may also want to estimate tasks to help with sprint planning and task breakdown.

> Remember: Estimates are not commitments. As the team learns more about a user story, the estimate may need to be revised. The important thing is to be transparent about the estimate and to update it as needed.

## Roles in Scrum:
In the Scrum framework, there are three main roles: the Scrum Master, the Product Owner, and the Development Team. Each of these roles performs specific functions that contribute to the success of the project, including task estimation.

### Scrum Master:
The Scrum Master is responsible for ensuring that the Scrum team follows the Scrum principles and practices. In relation to task estimation, the Scrum Master's responsibilities include:

- Facilitate the estimating process: The Scrum Master should guide the team in using appropriate estimating techniques, such as Planning Poker, and ensure that the estimating process is followed effectively.
- Promote transparency: The Scrum Master must foster an environment where task estimates are transparent and shared among all team members.
- Resolve impediments: If problems arise during the task estimation process, the Scrum Master must intervene to remove obstacles and ensure that the team can continue its work efficiently.
### Poduct Owner:
The Product Owner is responsible for representing customer interests and defining product requirements. In relation to task estimation, the Product Owner's responsibilities include:
- Prioritize the product backlog: The Product Owner should work with the team to prioritize product backlog items based on their value and complexity, which will influence task estimation.
- Provide clarity on requirements: The Product Owner must ensure that the product requirements are clear and well-defined, making it easier for the team to accurately estimate related tasks.
- Collaborate on the estimation: Although the Product Owner is not directly involved in task estimation, she should be available to answer questions and provide additional information that could influence the estimates.
### Development team:
The Development Team is made up of professionals who perform the work necessary to deliver a potentially shippable product increment at the end of each sprint. In relation to task estimation, the Development Team's responsibilities include:
- Actively participate in the estimation process: Team members should collaborate in estimating tasks using the techniques and tools provided, and share their knowledge and perspectives.
- Break down tasks into manageable units: The team should break down user stories or product backlog items into smaller, more manageable tasks to facilitate
itate your estimation and tracking during the sprint.
- Review and adjust estimates: As the team progresses through the sprint, new knowledge or circumstances may arise that affect initial estimates. It is the team's responsibility to review and adjust these estimates as necessary to ensure successful delivery of the product increment.
