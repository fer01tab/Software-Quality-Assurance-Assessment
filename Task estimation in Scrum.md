# Task estimation

## Why estimate in Scrum?

In Scrum, estimation is not about pinpoint accuracy, but rather about creating a shared understanding among the development team about the relative effort required for each user story. This shared understanding helps with:

- Sprint planning: The team can choose a set of user stories that they believe can be realistically completed within a sprint timeframe.
- Forecasting: The product owner can get a sense of how long it will take to complete the product backlog.
- Transparency: Stakeholders can see how much work is in progress and how quickly the team is delivering value.


## Estimation techniques in Scrum:

- Planning Poker: In Planning Poker, each team member estimates a user story relative to a predefined scale (e.g., Fibonacci sequence). Team members discuss their estimates and then vote again until they reach a consensus.
- T-Shirt Sizing: In T-Shirt Sizing, team members estimate a user story by assigning it a T-shirt size (e.g., XS, S, M, L, XL). This is a quick and easy technique that can be helpful for early-stage estimation.

- Ideal Days: In Ideal Days, team members estimate a user story by considering how many ideal days (i.e., days without interruptions) it would take to complete the story.

## What to estimate in Scrum?

In Scrum, the focus is on estimating user stories, not individual tasks. This is because user stories represent a unit of work that can be delivered to the product owner. However, teams may also want to estimate tasks to help with sprint planning and task breakdown.

> Remember: Estimates are not commitments. As the team learns more about a user story, the estimate may need to be revised. The important thing is to be transparent about the estimate and to update it as needed.
